									into two parts: (i) dynamics of rigid solids and (ii) strength of materials.

									The objective of the first part is to provide tools to analyze and design mechanical
									systems composed of rigid bodies. Based on classical methods used to study rigid
									bodies mechanisms such as Newton's laws of motions and torsors formulations, the
									main parts of this lecture are:
									<ul>
										<li>Modeling and parametrization of a mechanism</li>
										<li>Reminder concerning solid mechanics</li>
										<li>Theory of mechanisms</li>
										<li>Basic knowledge of energetics in mechanisms</li>
										<li>Modeling of contacts between rigid bodies</li>
									</ul>

									The objective of the second part is to provide basic knowledge in Strength of
									Materials so that the students can solve engineering problems and design engineering
									systems. More specifically, the aim is to understand the concepts of stress and
									strain as well as the constitutive relationships for homogeneous and isotropic
									beam-type structures. Students will be able to calculate stresses and strains in
									elements subjected to axial, shear, torsion or bending loads and to determine the
									strength limits. The main parts of the lecture are:
									<ul>
										<li>Generalities and assumptions on strength of materials</li>
										<li>Concept of torsor of internal forces</li>
										<li>Study of simple solicitations: Traction-Compression, Shear, Torsion, Bending
										</li>
